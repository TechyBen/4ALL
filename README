## Turn Loop
Each turn follows a single, deterministic sequence:

1. **Render**: Display current ship status, environment, and available actions.
2. **Choose Action**: Player selects one primary action for the turn.
3. **Resolve Action**: Apply outcomes of the chosen action (success/failure, resource changes, events).
4. **Apply Passive Effects**: Process ongoing system updates (decay, drain, wear, health changes).
5. **Update UI**: Refresh HUD/logs to reflect the new state.

## Turn Granularity
* **Discrete, action-based turns**: each player action advances time by a fixed unit (e.g., one "tick").
* Time cost is tied to the chosen action; heavier actions may advance multiple ticks.
* **Concurrent actions**: production systems, generators, and background jobs run as passive systems that consume/produce per tick, so multiple resource flows resolve together during the **Apply Passive Effects** step.
* **Base tick size**: choose a smallest tick unit (e.g., 1 minute or 10 seconds) and allow actions to advance N ticks; very long actions can fast-forward by processing multiple ticks in a batch while still applying passive updates each tick.
* **Skip/accelerate**: allow the player to advance time without a primary action (e.g., "wait 10 ticks") and optionally speed up resolution by simulating ticks in chunks while preserving per-tick ordering.

## Subsystems Updated Every Loop
* **Resource decay** (food, fuel, oxygen).
* **Power drain** (idle systems, active modules).
* **System wear** (durability degradation, fault accumulation).
* **Crew health** (stress, injury recovery/decline).

## Time Model
* **Turn-based loop** with **no background tick**; time advances only when an action is taken.
